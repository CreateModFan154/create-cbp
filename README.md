# Create: CBP (Customs and Border Protection) - WIP

**🚨 DISCLAIMER 🚨**

***WE DO NOT IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM SUPPORT ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES IN REAL LIFE.***

This is a Minecraft mod and is intended solely for entertainment and gameplay purposes. The contraband items featured in this mod are realistic but fictional and meant for fun within the context of the game. We strongly encourage everyone to follow all laws and ethical guidelines in real life.

**THIS IS NOT A DRUG DEALER SIMULATOR!**

## Overview

**Create: CBP** is an **in-development** Minecraft mod that introduces **Customs and Border Protection (CBP)** systems to your world. This mod allows players to set up automated **border stations**, process **cargo**, and **detect contraband** using the mechanics from the **Create mod**. While the mod is **still in development**, the goal is to create an immersive **border control** experience with **cargo scanning**, **contraband detection**, and **border patrol NPCs**.

## Features (WIP)

### Core Features (Planned):

* **Contraband Detection**: Identify and process illegal goods, including items like **"Blue Stuff"** (meth), **"Bag of 'Sugar'"** (coke), and **"Fake Money"**.
* **Automated Border Stations**: Use **Create mod** blocks (e.g., **conveyor belts**, **mechanical arms**, and **pistons**) to build and automate inspection stations.
* **NPC Guards**: Patrol the border and check for contraband. NPCs will potentially issue **fines**, **confiscations**, and even **arrests**.
* **Penalties**: Smuggling illegal goods may result in **fines**, **confiscations**, or **penal actions**. Players caught smuggling contraband will face consequences.

### Features in Development:

* **Contraband Types**: Current focus on **Blue Stuff**, **Bag of 'Sugar'**, and **Fake Money**. More contraband types like **Crack**, **Illegal Weapons**, and **Stolen Artifacts** are planned.
* **NPC Interactions**: NPCs will eventually interact with players and enforce border control rules, though this feature is **still under development**.
* **Vehicle Inspection**: Integration with **IV mod** (Immersive Vehicles) planned for vehicle cargo processing. This will allow for more immersive cargo checks.
* **Expanded Processing Systems**: Working on creating more intricate cargo scanning and detection mechanics.

### Final Thoughts

**Create: CBP** is still a work-in-progress, but we’re building toward a **fully automated customs and border control system** using **Create mod** mechanics. Stay tuned for updates as we continue development, and feel free to provide feedback or ideas!

This version clearly marks the mod as a **work-in-progress**, sets expectations about what’s available and what’s still being developed, and encourages users to test and provide feedback. It’s a more **open-ended** README that can be updated as development progresses. Let me know if you'd like further adjustments!
